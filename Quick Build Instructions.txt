Quick Start for building bitquarkd in Unix/Linux
-----------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8++-dev
sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev

cd src/leveldb
chmod +x build_detect_platform
./build_detect_platform build_config.mk ./
cd ..
make -f makefile.unix

First, make sure that the required packages for Qt4 development of your distribution are installed, these are

for Debian and Ubuntu  <= 11.10

apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev libdb4.8++-dev

for Ubuntu >= 12.04

apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev libdb++-dev libminiupnpc-dev

then execute the following:

qmake "USE_UPNP=1"
make

An executable named `bitquark-qt` will be built.
Alternatively, install `Qt Creator`_ and open the `bitquark-qt.pro` file.
